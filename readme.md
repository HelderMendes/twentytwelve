# Twenty Twelve

This was the temporary development home for the WordPress Twenty Twelve theme until July 11, 2012. **This repository is no longer under active development**. The official and up to date code is now available on [WordPress Trac](http://core.trac.wordpress.org/). See the [original ticket](http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/19978) for more details, and open new tickets on WordPress Trac if you encounter any bugs. Please do not open issues or submit pull requests here.

### What's with the weird directory structure?

We used [Forge](https://github.com/thethemefoundry/forge) during this stage of development to speed things up. When Twenty Twelve was checked back into WordPress core we stopped using Forge. The version of Twenty Twelve in this repository **will not** compile to the latest official version now available in WordPress.
